In an increasingly global network, project managers must proactively seek to understand cultural diversity, and how to work successfully with multi-national teams. Sensitivity to other groups, their social customs, and their means of doing business is key to success. Often, project managers will need to weigh all competing interests fairly and objectively in order to make the ethical decision that will have the most far-reaching benefits.

The type and complexity of these dilemmas can vary significantly from balancing the competing interests of stakeholders to adhering to conflicting legal, multi-cultural, and multi-national rules, regulations, and requirements. Addressing these issues is much more complex than simply deciding what is right and what is wrong. In an increasingly global network, project managers must proactively seek to understand cultural diversity, and how to work successfully with multi-national teams. Sensitivity to other groups, their social customs, and their means of doing business is key to success. Often, project managers will need to weigh all competing interests fairly and objectively in order to make the ethical decision that will have the most far-reaching benefits.  In this course, learners will explore the values underlying ethical decisions and behaviors as outlined in the PMI\\xc2\\xae Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. For each value, learners will be introduced to the integrity aspired to, as well as the mandatory conduct demanded of project managers to effectively manage projects and further promote project management as a profession. Topics covered include the behaviors that align with the core values of responsibility, respect, honesty, and fairness; how to integrate ethics into your project environments; and how to resolve ethical dilemmas. The course provides a foundational knowledge base reflecting the most up-to-date project management information so learners can effectively put principles to work at their own organizations.

The securitization process and the products involved are highly complex financial tools and transactions, which can limit investors' ability to monitor and manage risk. Securitization became a widespread practice in the 1970s, although examples of it can be found much earlier. It has experienced immense growth globally, by some estimates to around $13 trillion. Securitizations involving mortgages and other assets, such as credit card receivables, housing and auto loans, airline receivables, and student loans, have become common place. Securitization brings many advantages to the issuer in the form of lower funding costs, reduction in asset and liability mismatching, as well as lower capital requirements and transfer of credit risk.   This course introduces the concept of securitization and important aspects relating to it, such as the role of a special purpose vehicle and note tranching. It examines mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and the major risks faced by investors. Different asset-backed security (ABS) structures, which include securities backed by credit card receivables, home equity loans, auto loans, and student loans, are presented at a high level.

In order to do so, the investor should assess the fund's historical return and the amount of risk that the fund has taken to achieve that return, as well as other critical factors. To assess all this information, investors must be able to read and understand the fund prospectus and any other complementary information that is provided by the fund manager and other public sources.

Adjusting entries are then made to record accrued or deferred amounts followed by another trial balance to check equality of debits and credits. Financial statements are also prepared at this stage in the cycle. Finally, all temporary accounts are closed and a post-closing trial balance is prepared.  This course teaches you how to prepare a trial balance, make adjusting entries, and close the temporary account books at the end of an accounting period. It introduces several types of trial balances performed within the accounting cycle and walks you through the preparation of a trial balance. This course also teaches you how to classify and make adjusting entries and close the accounts at period end.']['Anyone either serving in an accounting role, or who just wants to have a working understanding of the accounting and bookkeeping functions, but who has no previous experience in accounting']</td>\n      <td>0.999895</td>\n      <td>203</td>\n      <td>Accounting for Companies' Stock Transactions and Dividends</td>\n      <td>[\"A publicly or privately held company, also known as a corporation, is an entity separate and distinct from its stockholders.

Stocks reacquired and held with the company are called treasury stocks. Companies often decide to share part of their net income, called dividends, with stockholders as reward for stockholders' investment risk in the company. Implications of issuing common and preferred stocks, treasury stocks, and dividends are very significant for companies' accounts.   This course presents basic concepts and accounting treatments involving companies' common and preferred stocks, treasury stocks, and dividends. The course aims at identifying key characteristics of incorporated organizations and how common equity transactions affect their financial position.

The type and complexity of these dilemmas can vary significantly from balancing the competing interests of stakeholders to adhering to conflicting legal, multi-cultural, and multi-national rules, regulations, and requirements. Addressing these issues is much more complex than simply deciding what is right and what is wrong. In an increasingly global network, project managers must proactively seek to understand cultural diversity, and how to work successfully with multi-national teams. Sensitivity to other groups, their social customs, and their means of doing business is key to success. Often, project managers will need to weigh all competing interests fairly and objectively in order to make the ethical decision that will have the most far-reaching benefits.  In this course, learners will explore the values underlying ethical decisions and behaviors as outlined in the PMI\\xc2\\xae Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. For each value, learners will be introduced to the integrity aspired to, as well as the mandatory conduct demanded of project managers to effectively manage projects and further promote project management as a profession. Topics covered include the behaviors that align with the core values of responsibility, respect, honesty, and fairness; how to integrate ethics into your project environments; and how to resolve ethical dilemmas. The course provides a foundational knowledge base reflecting the most up-to-date project management information so learners can effectively put principles to work at their own organizations.

The securitization process and the products involved are highly complex financial tools and transactions, which can limit investors' ability to monitor and manage risk. Securitization became a widespread practice in the 1970s, although examples of it can be found much earlier. It has experienced immense growth globally, by some estimates to around $13 trillion. Securitizations involving mortgages and other assets, such as credit card receivables, housing and auto loans, airline receivables, and student loans, have become common place. Securitization brings many advantages to the issuer in the form of lower funding costs, reduction in asset and liability mismatching, as well as lower capital requirements and transfer of credit risk.   This course introduces the concept of securitization and important aspects relating to it, such as the role of a special purpose vehicle and note tranching. It examines mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and the major risks faced by investors. Different asset-backed security (ABS) structures, which include securities backed by credit card receivables, home equity loans, auto loans, and student loans, are presented at a high level. Then, the course presents the structure of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) that include collateralized bond obligations (CBOs) and collateralized loan obligations (CLO), as well as how regular CDOs and Synthetic CDOs are used for arbitrage and balance sheet transactions.\"]['Financial services professionals, consultants, and sales professionals interested in providing or selling products and services to banks, investment companies, and other financial corporations, and everyone interested in creation and use of credit derivative instruments']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n229   ['The commodities and energy markets are generally considered to be some of the largest markets in existence. Every day billions of dollars of commodities such as oil, coal, gold, and sugar are bought and sold between various traders acting on behalf of producers, manufacturers, and financial institutions. The derivatives market has seen explosive growth around these markets over the decades. Although traditionally used by farmers and other manufacturers to protect themselves against price movements that would affect their profitability, derivatives are now widely used by many financial institutions as a way to profit on speculation and arbitrage. Financial institutions, such as banks and hedge funds, are profit seekers by their inherent nature and are willing to take risks in return for these profits. Hedgers, on the other hand, look to protect themselves by removing risk or hedging. These two different points of view complement each other and have allowed the market to grow rapidly and become quite liquid\\xe2\\x80\\x94 for every hedger there is almost always a speculator willing to take the opposite side of the trade.  This course covers the fundamental characteristics of the commodities and energy markets.

We then identify various financial contracts known as derivatives whereby these products may be bought or sold at a predetermined price, in specific quantities, and for delivery at a future date. The course focuses on the features of forward and futures commodity contracts and swap and option commodity contracts and their uses for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage.']['Financial services professionals, consultants, sales professionals interested in providing or selling products and services to banks, investment companies, other financial corporations, and everyone interested in understanding commodity and financial futures and forwards']                                                                                                                                                                       \n241   ['Money laundering is an illegal process of using legitimate means to conceal the true source of funds that are acquired through illegal activities, including drug trafficking and terrorism.

The type and complexity of these dilemmas can vary significantly from balancing the competing interests of stakeholders to adhering to conflicting legal, multi-cultural, and multi-national rules, regulations, and requirements. Addressing these issues is much more complex than simply deciding what is right and what is wrong. In an increasingly global network, project managers must proactively seek to understand cultural diversity, and how to work successfully with multi-national teams. Sensitivity to other groups, their social customs, and their means of doing business is key to success. Often, project managers will need to weigh all competing interests fairly and objectively in order to make the ethical decision that will have the most far-reaching benefits.  In this course, learners will explore the values underlying ethical decisions and behaviors as outlined in the PMI\\xc2\\xae Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. For each value, learners will be introduced to the integrity aspired to, as well as the mandatory conduct demanded of project managers to effectively manage projects and further promote project management as a profession. Topics covered include the behaviors that align with the core values of responsibility, respect, honesty, and fairness; how to integrate ethics into your project environments; and how to resolve ethical dilemmas. The course provides a foundational knowledge base reflecting the most up-to-date project management information so learners can effectively put principles to work at their own organizations.

A federal government is usually comprised of a host of governmental departments and various stakeholders, which can include, but are not limited to, individual states, provinces, and territories. A federal government delivers services, creates and enforces laws, maintains highways, collects taxes, defends national sovereignty, encourages investment, provides education, oversees environmental issues, and performs a host of other services to its citizens. Different nations, and their respective federal governments, all adopt strategies to overcome the challenges they face that can stagnate services, overextend budgets, cause intradepartmental barriers, and impede hiring the best employees. Federal governments are continually driven to find solutions through improving service delivery, reducing costs, opening departmental barriers, and attracting a talented workforce.     This course is designed to help learners understand key concepts, terminology, issues, and challenges associated with the federal government industry, and strategies employed to meet some of those challenges.

These instruments are defined as contracts that are traded over-the-counter between private parties. Due to their private nature, the inherent risks posed by such agreements have forced regulators to address legal, accounting, and tax issues related to these agreements. Standardized documentation and definitions have been created to allow for mutual understanding between the two parties and try to remove any vagueness in the contract details that may prove detrimental to either party. Standardization will never be complete for such agreements due to the specific requirements of different users from one contract to another; however, they hope to build on a mutual solid foundation while still allowing flexibility to meet end user requirements. Because proper accounting and taxation treatment of these products is constantly evolving, professional judgment plays a great role in these areas.  This course introduces regulatory documentation set out by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) and the legal issues that may arise due to a lack of proper documentation and understanding between two parties. It also examines the issue surrounding the definition of restructuring as a credit event. The course briefly covers regulatory issues, including centralized clearing mechanisms and collateral margins, and the accounting treatment and tax issues regarding credit derivatives.']['Financial services professionals, consultants, and sales professionals interested in providing or selling products and services to banks, investment companies, and other financial corporations, and everyone interested in creation and use of credit derivative instruments']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n1011  [\"The utilities industry is essential to modern living and the modern economy.

So the further you stray from communication methods that are rich in personal attributes (you can hear someone, see someone, use body language, interact with others) versus light in personal attributes (impersonal, one-way, static), the more apt you are to have a one-way, 'telling' type of communication. In this course, you'll learn how to select the best communication methods to convey your intention and target your audience. By doing so, you improve the odds of getting your message across, making your point, and leaving your audience feeling informed, enlightened, and engaged.\"]['Individuals who want to improve their interpersonal communication skills']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n231   ['Management of interest rates is an important aspect for any financial institution that lends or borrows funds, as well as for those that invest in fixed income instruments and any other company that uses debt to fund its operations.

With several subsidiary industries connected to and depending upon the agriculture industry, it continues to be one of the largest industries in the world and one of the most important for human existence. It's also one of the most vulnerable to changes in economic and political climate, market dynamics, and weather adversities. Growth in global demand over recent years has outpaced supply throughout the world, resulting in spiraling food prices. With scarce land and water resources, demands for alternative use of land, rampant urbanization, and climate change concerns, food security is at the top of the agenda for many national governments. However, industry players are adopting unique strategies and moving forward to overcome these challenges.  This course is designed to help learners understand key concepts, terminology, issues, and challenges associated with the agriculture industry, and strategies employed to meet some of those challenges.

There are listening traps that we all fall victim to from time to time, which diminish our effectiveness. Distractions, both internal and external, may keep us from having the most productive conversation if they're not removed or mitigated. Our thoughts and feelings often become roadblocks to effective listening when our biases, our emotional reactions, or our focus on preparing to speak interferes with our effectiveness. Additionally, a listener's own speech can shut down the flow of information. Finally, a roadblock that everyone faces at some point is boredom. Listening to a boring speaker or topic can provide challenges for effectively receiving and retaining critical information. Fortunately, there is hope. We can all learn to listen better despite boredom. In this course, you'll review techniques for overcoming roadblocks to listening.

Therefore, it is vital to identify these loans and determine the reasons why they occur. Warning signs typically exist that may inform loan portfolio administrators of impending issues with consumer or business loans. When loans do become problematic, there are certain measures that banks can take to protect themselves, such as restructuring debt, liquidating, or securing assets. Such techniques were widely used during the global credit crisis of the early 21st century, and continue to be relevant in a contemporary credit risk management setting. It is important for analysts to understand the different kinds of consumer loans and tools such as credit scorecards that assist in determining the credit risk level of borrowers.  This course introduces non-performing loans and gives an overview of their warning signs. It also describes ways that banks can protect themselves from non-performing loans and minimize any associated losses. It then identifies types of consumer loans and how consumer credit scorecards are used to distinguish high risk borrowers from low risk ones.

A set of international banking regulations, known as Basel I, was introduced in 1988. This accord recommended a minimum capital requirement of 8% of risk-weighted assets for banks operating internationally. The way in which the adequate capital requirement for banks is calculated has changed dramatically since then. Following a series of revisions and impact analyses, implementation of a new set of regulations, Basel II, began in 2007. Basel II aimed to strengthen the stability of the international banking system through capital requirements that were aligned closely to the underlying credit, market, and operational risks. Basel III began implementation in 2013 and lays down stricter capital standards, additional capital buffers, and higher risk-weighted assets and minimum capital ratio requirements.  This course provides an overview of the main features of the Basel regulations relating to capital adequacy requirements. It discusses various elements of Basel I, including the approach for determining capital adequacy and on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet items and associated risks. The course then identifies factors that led to the development of the Basel II and Basel III standards.

The type and complexity of these dilemmas can vary significantly from balancing the competing interests of stakeholders to adhering to conflicting legal, multi-cultural, and multi-national rules, regulations, and requirements. Addressing these issues is much more complex than simply deciding what is right and what is wrong. In an increasingly global network, project managers must proactively seek to understand cultural diversity, and how to work successfully with multi-national teams. Sensitivity to other groups, their social customs, and their means of doing business is key to success. Often, project managers will need to weigh all competing interests fairly and objectively in order to make the ethical decision that will have the most far-reaching benefits.  In this course, learners will explore the values underlying ethical decisions and behaviors as outlined in the PMI\\xc2\\xae Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. For each value, learners will be introduced to the integrity aspired to, as well as the mandatory conduct demanded of project managers to effectively manage projects and further promote project management as a profession. Topics covered include the behaviors that align with the core values of responsibility, respect, honesty, and fairness; how to integrate ethics into your project environments; and how to resolve ethical dilemmas. The course provides a foundational knowledge base reflecting the most up-to-date project management information so learners can effectively put principles to work at their own organizations.

This activity has grown and become more sophisticated as it keeps pace with modern technology, leaving authorities world-wide with the difficult task of trying to stay one step ahead of the criminals. Various unreliable estimates have been produced to measure this practice globally, with some estimates quoting sums as large as percentage points of the global economy. Because of this, countries across the world have created joint programs to combat and prevent money laundering.  This course introduces the concept of money laundering and identifies the different types, enabling circumstances and common indicators for this activity. It also acknowledges global initiatives such as the Financial Action Task Force, the Basel Committee, and the International Money Laundering Information Network, among others, that set recommended actions to prevent and combat money laundering.

The type and complexity of these dilemmas can vary significantly from balancing the competing interests of stakeholders to adhering to conflicting legal, multi-cultural, and multi-national rules, regulations, and requirements. Addressing these issues is much more complex than simply deciding what is right and what is wrong. In an increasingly global network, project managers must proactively seek to understand cultural diversity, and how to work successfully with multi-national teams. Sensitivity to other groups, their social customs, and their means of doing business is key to success. Often, project managers will need to weigh all competing interests fairly and objectively in order to make the ethical decision that will have the most far-reaching benefits.  In this course, learners will explore the values underlying ethical decisions and behaviors as outlined in the PMI\\xc2\\xae Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. For each value, learners will be introduced to the integrity aspired to, as well as the mandatory conduct demanded of project managers to effectively manage projects and further promote project management as a profession. Topics covered include the behaviors that align with the core values of responsibility, respect, honesty, and fairness; how to integrate ethics into your project environments; and how to resolve ethical dilemmas. The course provides a foundational knowledge base reflecting the most up-to-date project management information so learners can effectively put principles to work at their own organizations. This course will assist in preparing the learner for the PMI\\xc2\\xae certification exam.

These instruments are defined as contracts that are traded over-the-counter between private parties.

Standardized documentation and definitions have been created to allow for mutual understanding between the two parties and try to remove any vagueness in the contract details that may prove detrimental to either party. Standardization will never be complete for such agreements due to the specific requirements of different users from one contract to another; however, they hope to build on a mutual solid foundation while still allowing flexibility to meet end user requirements. Because proper accounting and taxation treatment of these products is constantly evolving, professional judgment plays a great role in these areas.

Every day billions of dollars of commodities such as oil, coal, gold, and sugar are bought and sold between various traders acting on behalf of producers, manufacturers, and financial institutions. The derivatives market has seen explosive growth around these markets over the decades. Although traditionally used by farmers and other manufacturers to protect themselves against price movements that would affect their profitability, derivatives are now widely used by many financial institutions as a way to profit on speculation and arbitrage. Financial institutions, such as banks and hedge funds, are profit seekers by their inherent nature and are willing to take risks in return for these profits. Hedgers, on the other hand, look to protect themselves by removing risk or hedging. These two different points of view complement each other and have allowed the market to grow rapidly and become quite liquid\\xe2\\x80\\x94 for every hedger there is almost always a speculator willing to take the opposite side of the trade.  This course covers the fundamental characteristics of the commodities and energy markets. We examine the types of underlying products that are traded, such as various metals and energy producing chemicals, and we also examine what they are used for. We then identify various financial contracts known as derivatives whereby these products may be bought or sold at a predetermined price, in specific quantities, and for delivery at a future date. The course focuses on the features of forward and futures commodity contracts and swap and option commodity contracts and their uses for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n223   ['Money laundering is an illegal process of using legitimate means to conceal the true source of funds that are acquired through illegal activities, including drug trafficking and terrorism. This activity has grown and become more sophisticated as it keeps pace with modern technology, leaving authorities world-wide with the difficult task of trying to stay one step ahead of the criminals. Various unreliable estimates have been produced to measure this practice globally, with some estimates quoting sums as large as percentage points of the global economy. Because of this, countries across the world have created joint programs to combat and prevent money laundering.  This course introduces the concept of money laundering and identifies the different types, enabling circumstances and common indicators for this activity.

A relatively new but growing, global industry, biotechnology involves engineering biological molecules and microbes with desirable new properties. This re-engineering of natural organisms can lead to the development of new and better drugs, medical treatments customized for an individual's biological makeup, disease-resistant crops, and new industrial processes. Some of biotechnology's promises have been delivered, but many have not. False starts are common in an industry where the development of new products is uncertain, time consuming, and expensive. Companies in the industry face other obstacles as well \\xe2\\x80\\x93 pricing pressures and a decline in funding, for example. To address such challenges, industry players can adopt new cost-cutting and efficiency measures or partner with other biotechnology or pharmaceutical firms. They also need to deal with increased regulation and strong moral opposition to their activities \\xe2\\x80\\x93 particularly in the field of genetic engineering. In response, biotechnology companies seek to educate the wider community about their activities and justify the benefits and safety of those activities to the public, the government, and investors.

These instruments are defined as contracts that are traded over-the-counter between private parties. Due to their private nature, the inherent risks posed by such agreements have forced regulators to address legal, accounting, and tax issues related to these agreements. Standardized documentation and definitions have been created to allow for mutual understanding between the two parties and try to remove any vagueness in the contract details that may prove detrimental to either party. Standardization will never be complete for such agreements due to the specific requirements of different users from one contract to another; however, they hope to build on a mutual solid foundation while still allowing flexibility to meet end user requirements. Because proper accounting and taxation treatment of these products is constantly evolving, professional judgment plays a great role in these areas.  This course introduces regulatory documentation set out by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) and the legal issues that may arise due to a lack of proper documentation and understanding between two parties. It also examines the issue surrounding the definition of restructuring as a credit event. The course briefly covers regulatory issues, including centralized clearing mechanisms and collateral margins, and the accounting treatment and tax issues regarding credit derivatives.']                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n751   [\"Do you know what the eight parts of speech are? Such a question probably brings back memories of dull grammar lessons in elementary school, where you first heard the term parts of speech. What's the point of learning these now? Being reminded of the functions of different parts of speech can help you write with more confidence. The parts of speech are the building blocks of sentences, so finding out about them can help you skillfully combine words into meaningful sentences.   This course defines the functions of the eight parts of speech: nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, prepositions, interjections, and conjunctions. In particular, it focuses on how to use them effectively, and correctly. And it provides special focus on nouns, adverbs, adjectives, and verbs, including verb tenses.

When an investor puts money in a company in return for part ownership, the company issues stocks to the investor. Stock is the evidence of the ownership interest of the stockholder. Sometimes a company also reacquires some of its outstanding stocks from its stockholders for retiring, holding, or reselling purposes. Stocks reacquired and held with the company are called treasury stocks. Companies often decide to share part of their net income, called dividends, with stockholders as reward for stockholders' investment risk in the company. Implications of issuing common and preferred stocks, treasury stocks, and dividends are very significant for companies' accounts.
